# What is workjournal?

Workjournal is a command-line tool to help you take notes on what you are getting done at your desk. It's designed to be used in any situation where you have job numbers, ticket IDs, or anything else like that where you'd like to be able to easily track your activity by those numbers and reference back to it easily.

Workjournal stores information nearly exclusively in plain text and Markdown, with easy configuration in YAML, meaning that even if you're not a command line whiz or a programmer extraordinaire, you'll still be able to get some good use out of this tool.

Plus, it's written in Rust, a reliable, fast, and memory-safe language that runs on all platforms.

## Pardon the dust!

Workjournal is still under construction - so it's not yet ready to use! As more and more features get added, I'll mention them here.
